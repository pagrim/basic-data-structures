# Data Structures

These are my solutions to week 1 of the [Coursera Data Structures course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/), which is part of the [Data Structures and Algorithms Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms).

This includes solutions to these problems:
* _Bracket Checker_ - check valid combinations of brackets using a stack
* _Packet Processor_ - simulate packets arriving in a buffer
* _Tree Height_ - Calculate height of a tree

I also included some implementations of a fixed size queue and a queue from a doubly linked list.
